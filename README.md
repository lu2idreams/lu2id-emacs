# lu2id-emacs

My own fairly basic modifications, mostly for private use.

## Installation

After installing vanilla emacs, back up the default .emacs.d directory and .emacs file. Move "emacs_hidden_dir" to your home directory and rename it to .emacs.d. Move "emacs_hidden" to your home directory and rename it to ".emacs". After launching emacs, run M-x package-refresh-contents.
