# lu2id-emacs

My own fairly basic modifications, mostly for private use, to take notes in markdown and do basic coding in R.

## Installation

After installing vanilla emacs, back up the default ".emacs.d" directory and ".emacs" file. Move "emacs_hidden_dir" to your home directory and rename it to ".emacs.d". Move "emacs_hidden" to your home directory and rename it to ".emacs". After launching emacs, run M-x package-refresh-contents.
